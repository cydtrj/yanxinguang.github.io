"I want to become a more authentic person, and news gives me this strength and pursuit".

I graduated from the School of Literature at Anhui University of Finance and Economics, majoring in Network and New Media. I am particularly interested in news and communication.

On this website, you can explore my resume, personal experience, and learn about my different aspects.

In my major classes, I consistently ranked at the top and achieved first place overall.

I have a strong interest in journalism and media. During my college years, I participated in academic training programs to enhance my abilities and gained experience in journalism through internships at newspapers and working in the school's media center. As a result, my news interviewing and writing skills have improved.

Regarding my experience, I have participated in various campus activities and competitions. These include presenting a program, performing in a reading program for a large school event, participating in the school athletic meet as an athlete, setting up a studio to apply for a business incubation program, and becoming the main manager of a public website for operation and planning.
