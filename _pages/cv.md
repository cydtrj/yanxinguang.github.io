## Social Practice

### 2021 Anhui University of Finance and Economics summer "three to the countryside" social practice program

#### Position and Time
* Team project leader, July 2021 - September 2021

#### Content
> Research on the local 'special culture' of Bengbu City. Bengbu City has a rich cultural history and resources, but they have not received the attention they deserve. To address this issue, I conducted research on the cultural characteristics of Bengbu City using questionnaires, field visits, interviews, documentation, and off-site study. Through this research, I discovered that some aspects of the culture are not receiving the attention they deserve. The use of questionnaires, interviews, and field visits helped me to identify these issues. Corresponding issues related to cultural neglect require attention. To assess the degree of cultural awareness among local residents, questionnaires, interviews, and field visits should be conducted. The opinions and views of the local residents should be collected and analyzed to determine the reasons for the current situation. Finally, measures should be taken to protect the city's cultural characteristics and promote outstanding cultural features. Finally, we will visit other cities with excellent cultural protection and promotion and learn from their experiences. Based on local conditions, we will propose corresponding suggestions for the Bengbu area and ultimately compile a survey report.

#### Responsibilities
* As the person responsible for the content, your role is to lead team members and organize the division of labor to ensure clear and close cooperation.
* You will also be responsible for researching relevant literature and creating questionnaires for online and offline distribution and collection.
* Additionally, you will lead the team in conducting field visits to observe and conduct character interviews on targeted issues to collect effective information and data.
* Lead the team members to visit and study in other places to learn from successful experiences and produce written materials.
* Organize the survey report in a clear and well-structured manner for reference.

#### Achievements
* The team was awarded the title of 'Excellent Practice Team' during the Anhui University of Finance and Economics Summer Social Practice Activity in 2021.

#### Content
> E-commerce is playing an increasingly important role in helping farmers alleviate poverty and promote rural revitalization. Guzhen County has explored the 'agricultural food station + outlets + poverty alleviation households' model to assist in poverty alleviation efforts. The agricultural grain station was developed by Anhui Province Green Xin Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd. as an e-commerce platform to assist with sales. It utilizes a production and processing model of 'branch + company (cooperatives) + poverty alleviation households' and a gathering attraction mode of 'tourism + picking + Net sales (live)' to expand the income channels of farmers. This creates a closely linked agricultural industry chain for production, supply, and marketing. This study focuses on the integration of the agricultural food station industrial chain in Guzhen County as a means of promoting rural revitalization. The aim is to explore the characteristics of the agricultural products industry in Guzhen and develop a scalable e-commerce model that can help farmers and rural industries prosper. The study presents a typical case of successful online agricultural product sales and emphasizes the importance of integrating e-commerce into rural revitalization efforts.

#### Achievements
* Cultivate leading industries in rural areas, promote the quality and efficiency of agriculture；
* Explore the new pattern of rural e-commerce and extend the agricultural industry chain；
* Stabilize small family production and provide information services for decentralized small farmers.
