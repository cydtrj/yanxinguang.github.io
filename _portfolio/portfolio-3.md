### Work 1

#### Introduction
> This is an issue of "Wedding Dresses".
There is a big park near our school where many couples come to take wedding photos every season. Every time I pass by, I see their happy faces, they are of different ages, some of them are about to enter into marriage, some of them have been married for dozens of years to make up for the wedding photos, so I was deeply affected by this, and the idea of wanting to record it rose in my heart, so I planned an issue of new media works about "wedding dress". Therefore, I planned a new media work about "wedding dress", combining the beauty of the wedding dress, the love of the main character, and the scenery of the park, and using new media editing techniques to show a different kind of "scenery". 
(Disclaimer: I didn't take the pictures, I provided the idea and creativity, and then I looked for a group of students to collaborate on the photo shoot, and finally presented this new media work).

### Work 2

#### Introduction
> This is an issue of "Hugs".
Hugging is the simplest and greatest form of physical contact. It can heal our sadness, uneasiness, loneliness and other bad emotions, but Chinese people are often shy to hug, so I wanted to find some representative, warm and touching hugs, so I edited the clips about hugs from some social media videos with some introductory text, and combined them into this warm new media work.

### Work 3

#### Introduction
> This is an installment of stories about "separation" and "love".
Every year, the start of the school year means that a large number of new students from different regions leave their hometowns for an unfamiliar city, and it also means the separation of children and parents. When I was a sophomore helping the freshmen at the beginning of the school year, I was touched by the touching images of parents and their children who were hard to part with each other, so I took a photo of them with my Polaroid camera and gave the photo to them as a souvenir, and in the process, I also learned the stories of each family. In the process, I also learned about the stories of each family, which are all about the love of parents for their children.
