> This is a news investigation about the chaos of "shared electric bikes", which was conducted during my internship at a news organization.
In the city where my university is located, there are electric bicycles lying on the ground everywhere, and the phenomenon of "two people in one car" is common, which brings great safety hazards and management problems to people's traveling as well as city management, so I investigated the densely populated areas and interviewed relevant people to form an investigation report. Therefore, I investigated the local densely populated areas and interviewed the relevant people, formed an investigation report, and the report was characterized by the provincial leaders, I was also praised.
