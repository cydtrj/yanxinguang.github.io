## Work 1
#### *The woman who was "picked up" disappeared in the sound of firecrackers*

### Introduction
> In rural areas, villages and families generally hold a positive attitude towards the marriage of intellectually disabled women. Intellectual disabled women in rural areas can enter marriage, but this does not mean that their marital rights have been realized and protected. On the contrary, Pan Lu believes that intellectually disabled women lack autonomy in their marriage decision-making, and their own wishes and opinions are completely ignored. Women with intellectual disabilities find it difficult to obtain sufficient emotional comfort from their husbands. Their lives are always determined and arranged by able-bodied individuals, and they are unable to actively voice their opinions, let alone improve their own situation through their own efforts. In rural areas, the obstacles faced by intellectually disabled individuals are not only physiological, but also social and cultural factors. They are a group of speechless people.

## Work 2
#### *The epidemic swept through villages*

### Introduction
> In the middle and late December, the majority of villages experienced a wave of COVID-19 infection. New Year's Day has just passed, and the village has lost its lively atmosphere from previous years. The elderly gather together with coughing sounds, discussing which old person in the nearby village's memory has passed away again. The continuous sound of suona around the village breaks the silence of the village after the ban on firecrackers. For many elderly people in the village, Omicron has no name. They only know that they have a cold and fever, and occasionally say, "Are you positive?". Most elderly people have many underlying diseases, and after infection, they simply take some cold and fever medicine. When they become seriously ill, they only go to the village clinic to get some water. Even many elderly people do not know what "ibuprofen" is, and antigens are even more elusive in the village. In this way, amidst the tug of contempt and procrastination, some elderly people ultimately failed to survive this winter. This is an observation of elderly people infected with the epidemic in rural areas of northern Anhui. The remaining empty nest elderly in the village can only wait and rely on their lives in the face of the epidemic.
