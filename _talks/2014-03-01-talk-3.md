## Title
### *Ping An Entering the Pocket*

## Introduction

> Conduct market research on Ping An Bank's service products, competitors, target groups, etc., and compile a planning plan for Ping An Bank, including market environment analysis, marketing strategy analysis, creative design, media planning, and cost budgeting. Based on the "money making" needs of young people (college students and graduates), put Ping An Bank's financial products into their pockets, Let Ping An Bank's mobile "pocket" accompany young people's growth, help young people successfully "make money", and help Ping An Bank achieve great transformation! I use a combination of online and offline activities, including game co branding blind boxes, competition event naming, job program sponsorship, and local life cooperation, to achieve brand appeal by considering marketing strategies as four major stages.
