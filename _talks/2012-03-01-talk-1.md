**Title:** Here I See Stars (Interviews with Autistic Children, Family, and School)

**Personal experience:** After three days, I went from school to a local special education school in Bengbu to see these special children eating and attending classes with them. During this process, I was at a loss. I experienced things that I had never experienced before, such as the crying and fussing of children, the confusion and helplessness of adults, and the kindness of teachers. A mother with autism held my hand and said, "She believes her child will definitely be good.", But at present, medical methods in the world cannot cure autism, but this obsession is the driving force that supports this mother to continue. There are too many cases. Some families have more than one child who is a special child, as well as single fathers with two autistic children. They are unfortunate, but in this school, they seem to have found a group and found light. They share their daily lives together, and at that moment, their faces show a smile. This place seems to be an island, well protected by society, It's like an unfortunate gathering place that makes people deeply saddened, and all I can do is keep a record.
