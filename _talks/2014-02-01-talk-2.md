**Title of the work:** Remaining and Leaving: The Disappearance of a Village

**Abstract:** This is a sample of the disappearance of villages in northern Anhui. With the intensification of urbanization, a large number of rural laborers have flooded into cities. In the collision between urban and rural areas, there is a material and value absorption of the younger generation from the opponent city, as well as a contradiction between the elderly and their offspring due to resource scarcity. For rural areas, groups composed of acquaintances are being replaced by those from a society of acquaintances The disintegration of the city, with the new generation born in the city, the middle-aged generation settling down in the city, and the old generation gradually aging in the countryside. The intergenerational inheritance and ideological chain formed by ancestral memories, customs, and worldly wisdom is breaking down.
