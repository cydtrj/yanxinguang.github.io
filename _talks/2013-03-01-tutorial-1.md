## Title
### *《Residents living in the mountains yearn for a "water dependent" lifestyle》*

## Introduction

> Due to the lack of access to tap water, residents of the Kaoshan Community in Jingshan Town, Huaiyuan County either drill deep wells at high prices or go to water selling points to buy water from buckets, which is very inconvenient. The local government responded that in response to the current water use situation of residents in the Kaoshan community, the local government has incorporated it into people's livelihood issues, and the next step will be to solve it through the People's Congress representative vote system.
