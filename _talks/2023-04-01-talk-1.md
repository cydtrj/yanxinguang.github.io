## Title
### *Blue Water Defense Battle - Leading the Construction of Urban Green Official Website*

## Introduction

> This project mainly adopts top pipe construction, also known as non excavation construction technology, which is a pipeline burial construction technology that requires no excavation or less excavation. Non excavation engineering technology has completely solved the problems of damage to urban buildings and road traffic congestion during pipeline burial construction, highlighting its advantages in stabilizing soil layers and environmental protection. This is very important for cities with busy traffic, dense population, numerous ground buildings, and complex underground pipelines. Our team has made significant achievements in innovation and entrepreneurship around this technology.

## Responsibilities
* Extract the core content of the business plan for PPT production;
* Communicate with team members in a timely manner to update pipeline construction data, technical highlights, and other content in a timely manner;
* During the roadshow, explain the core content and technology of the project and promptly answer the questions raised by the judges;
